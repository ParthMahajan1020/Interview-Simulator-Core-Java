# Interview Simulator – Core Java Project

A console-based Interview Simulator built using pure Core Java.  
This project simulates a real technical interview by evaluating a candidate through MCQs, theory questions, and coding logic questions, followed by a detailed scorecard and feedback.

## Features

- Role-based interview flow  
  - Java Intern → Hard level questions  
  - Java Developer → Medium level questions  

- Question types:
  - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
  - Theory-based questions
  - Coding logic questions

- Difficulty levels:
  - MEDIUM
  - HARD

- Automatic evaluation and scoring
- Section-wise marks (MCQ / Theory / Coding)
- Final percentage, grade, and interview feedback
- Fully console-based application

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: Java  
- Concepts Used:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
  - Abstract classes and method overriding
  - Collections (ArrayList)
  - `instanceof` operator
  - Scanner for input handling

No frameworks or external libraries used.

## How It Works

1. Candidate enters name and role.
2. Interview engine selects questions based on role difficulty.
3. Questions are displayed one by one in the console.
4. Answers are evaluated automatically:
   - MCQ → exact answer match
   - Theory → keyword-based evaluation
   - Coding → logic keywords and explanation length
5. Marks are awarded instantly.
6. Final scorecard, percentage, grade, and feedback are displayed.
